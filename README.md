JQUERY SALARY CALCULATOR


## DESCRIPTION ##

This project was built to take a users input consiting of Name, Employee ID, Job Title, and Annual Salary and output the monthly cost. We created a new object to house the user input information and appended it to the table to output on the DOM. The annual salaries were needed to be divided by 12 so we can understand the monthly cost of each employee. We then had to determine whether the monthly cost was to high or not, our not to exceed cost was $20,000.
